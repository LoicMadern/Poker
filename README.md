# Poker
A school project done in 2 month in 2020, by a group of 4 persons including me . This is a version of the Texas hold 'em lightened. Where 2 hands are compared to determine the winner
The main file to run the project is name "Poker"



Example of entries:


             Player1:
             4C 10S 6S 6C 10H    //2 Pairs (6 & 10) Highest Card 4

             Player2:
             AD 6D 10C 6H 10D    //2 Pairs (6 & 10) Highest Card A


             The player 2 win with the highest card = A


             //value + color
             // String []specPossible = {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8","9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"};
             // String [] possibleColor ={"C","H","S","D"};
             //do a space between each card
             //impossible to entry 2 or more times the same card
